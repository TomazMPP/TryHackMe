## Introduction</h2>
Have you ever wondered why you need an IP address to access the Internet? Is it true that an IP address can uniquely identify the user? Are you curious to learn what the life of a packet looks like? If the answer is yes, letâ€™s dive in!

This room is the first room in a series of four rooms dedicated to introducing the user to vital networking concepts and the most common networking protocols:

Networking Concepts (this room)
Networking Essentials
Networking Core Protocols
Networking Secure Protocols

### Learning Objectives</h3>
By the time you finish this room, you will have learned about the following:

ISO OSI network model
IP addresses, subnets, and routing
TCP, UDP, and port numbers
How to connect to an open TCP port from the command line

| Layer Number | Layer Name         | Main Function                                         | Example Protocols and Standards           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Layer 7      | Application layer  | Providing services and interfaces to applications     | HTTP,Â FTP,Â DNS,Â POP3,Â SMTP,Â IMAP          |
| Layer 6      | Presentation layer | Data encoding, encryption, and compression            | Unicode,Â MIME, JPEG, PNG, MPEG            |
| Layer 5      | Session layer      | Establishing, maintaining, and synchronising sessions | NFS, RPC                                  |
| Layer 4      | Transport layer    | End-to-end communication and data segmentation        | UDP,Â TCP                                  |
| Layer 3      | Network layer      | Logical addressing and routing between networks       | IP, ICMP, IPSec                           |
| Layer 2      | Data link layer    | Reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes         | Ethernet (802.3), WiFi (802.11)           |
| Layer 1      | Physical layer     | Physical data transmission media                      | Electrical, optical, and wireless signals |

RFC 1918 defines the following three ranges of private IP addresses:

- `10.0.0.0`Â -Â `10.255.255.255`Â (`10/8`)
- `172.16.0.0`Â -Â `172.31.255.255`Â (`172.16/12`)
- `192.168.0.0`Â -Â `192.168.255.255`Â (`192.168/16`)
