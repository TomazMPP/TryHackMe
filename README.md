## 🔥 Why this repo?

This repo serves as a living archive of my cybersecurity training on the TryHackMe platform, focused on practical hands-on learning. I use it to:
- Track my progress
- Solidify concepts by documenting them
- Share walkthroughs and writeups of rooms and challenges
- Note key takeaways and commands
- Help others who might be stuck or just getting started

## ✍️ Writeups

I provide writeups for rooms and challenges I've completed, respecting TryHackMe's rules on content sharing. All writeups are meant for **educational purposes only** and should not be used to bypass learning.

---

## 📈 Progress

I update this repo as I go. You can check my current profile stats [here](https://tryhackme.com/p/fxCogit).

If you see a room listed with no writeup yet, it's probably in progress or pending cleanup.
